            <p>Our Journey started with a N.O. in Siliguri and we took NO as New Opportunity and
            that has made all the difference. In 2015, The Pocket Money Campaign we
            organized for Nepal Relief was accepted as one of the Top World's Best Campaigns
            in UN and was projected in one of the side-events at UNGA. Further, we mobilized
            more than 5000+ youth in the distribution of 100,001 plants with the message of
            "Share One, Plant One." In fact, my journey had also been featured in the <span> <a href="https://social.un.org/youth-flash/March2016.html" target="_blank" style="color: black;">UN Youth Flash Newsletter.</a> </span></p>

            Youth of Siliguri, which has been appreciated for its innovative campaigns as it
            was projected in the side event at United Nations General Assembly in 2015.</p>
